        "Apple's (AAPL) efforts to replace Qualcomm (QCOM) as a supplier of 5G modem chips for its iPhone have hit a developmental snag, a prominent Apple stock analyst said Tuesday. Qualcomm stock rose on the news. In a Twitter thread, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple appears to have \"failed\" in its internal development of a 5G modem chip. That means Qualcomm will remain the exclusive supplier of 5G iPhone modem chips through the second half of 2023, he said. Qualcomm had previously estimated that it would supply just 20% of those iPhone chips in late 2023. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the report. \"I believe Apple will continue to develop its own 5G chips,\" Kuo said. \"But by the time Apple succeeds and can replace Qualcomm, Qualcomm's other new businesses should have grown enough to significantly offset the negative impacts caused by the order loss of iPhone 5G chips.\" On the stock market today, Qualcomm stock rose 3.5% to close at 131.60. Apple stock dropped 3% to 137.44 in an overall down day for stocks.",

        "Now that Q2 has come to end, the focus on Wall Street will turn to the second quarter results.

In fact, Ives thinks Apple’s “unparalleled” installed base of 1 billion iPhones is not properly appreciated and provides the company with a big advantage over other tech giants. The analyst is of the mind investors are underestimating the “stickiness” of the iPhone upgrade cycle and estimates that around 240 million of the 1 billion iPhones have yet to upgrade to a new smartphone over the past 3.5 years. “This importantly speaks to the Apple growth path over the next 12 to 18 months as iPhone 14 is set to be unveiled in the September timeframe,” Ives confidently wrapped up.

        "As automakers prepare to release second quarter delivery numbers, concern is growing on Wall Street that Tesla’s (TSLA) report could be a big downer. In particular, the concern is over Tesla’s deliveries from its Shanghai gigafactory, which was shut down for most of April and took some time to ramp up to pre-shut down levels. Recall that in May and parts of June the factory was operating in a “closed-loop” system in which workers were residing and working at the factory in limited shifts. Despite CEO Elon Musk warning Tesla employees of an “insane end-of-quarter delivery push,” Wall Street sell-side analysts are still taking down their second quarter delivery estimates, only days before Tesla’s Q2 delivery and production report will come out. First up is Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank, known as a Tesla bull on the Street. Rosner cut his Q2 delivery estimate by 65,000 vehicles, to 245,000. Rosner said this cut reflects a “prolonged COVID-19–related shutdown and logistical challenges in the Shanghai factory” for Tesla. Rosner reiterated his Buy rating but cut his price target for Tesla to \$1,125 from \$1,250. Next up is Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney, who is expecting weak Q2 results across the board for the autos sector due to the COVID restrictions in China, though especially for Tesla given its “higher exposure to the Shanghai/China region.” Delaney notes the bank had lowered its Q2 delivery estimates way back at the end of May due to the Shanghai shutdown and Tesla’s start-up costs for Giga Berlin and Giga Austin. Delaney now sees “downside risk to [Goldman's] 261K delivery assumption for 2Q given recent company comments on challenges ramping in Texas and Berlin, and deliveries could be about in line with buy-side consensus at around 250K.” Delaney has a Buy rating on Tesla with a \$1,000 price target. Finally, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities just put out a note this morning on Tesla. Ives, known as one of the biggest Tesla bulls on the Street, is...",

        "Tesla  (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc. Report completely dominates the electric vehicle market.  Newcomers like Rivian  (RIVN) - Get Rivian Automotive Inc. Report and Lucid  (LCID) - Get Lucid Group Inc. Report with a market cap of \$26.06 billion and \$32.03 billion, respectively, don't even appear in Tesla's rearview mirror. In addition to investors, the Texan vehicle manufacturer is winning its bet to become the brand to turn to when you want to buy an electric vehicle despite strong competition. This year, most automakers in the US market started producing new models to compete with its Model 3 and Model S sedans and its Model Y and Model X SUVs/crossovers. But so far Tesla is still managing to keep ahead. However, a rival is emerging and it is not the one we believe. Indeed, this rival is not GM, which has promised to produce over one million electric vehicles per year by 2025. Nor is it Ford and Volkswagen  (VLKAF) , which have made Tesla their main target and are in a phase of announcements and production of new models to seduce deep America. Ford is counting in particular on the F-150 Lightning, the version of the legendary F-150 pickup. Tesla's rival does not make a lot of noise and Elon Musk, the whimsical and charismatic CEO of Tesla, himself noticed it. This is the South Korean vehicle manufacturer Hyundai  (HYMLF) . Sawyer Merritt, a Musk fan and Tesla investor, recently shared a screenshot showing the top 5 automakers by market share in the electrical sector in the United States.

          "Tesla  (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc. Report completely dominates the electric vehicle market.  Newcomers like Rivian  (RIVN) - Get Rivian Automotive Inc. Report and Lucid  (LCID) - Get Lucid Group Inc. Report with a market cap of \$26.06 billion and \$32.03 billion, respectively, don't even appear in Tesla's rearview mirror. In addition to investors, the Texan vehicle manufacturer is winning its bet to become the brand to turn to when you want to buy an electric vehicle despite strong competition. This year, most automakers in the US market started producing new models to compete with its Model 3 and Model S sedans and its Model Y and Model X SUVs/crossovers. But so far Tesla is still managing to keep ahead. However, a rival is emerging and it is not the one we believe. Indeed, this rival is not GM, which has promised to produce over one million electric vehicles per year by 2025. Nor is it Ford and Volkswagen  (VLKAF) , which have made Tesla their main target and are in a phase of announcements and production of new models to seduce deep America. Ford is counting in particular on the F-150 Lightning, the version of the legendary F-150 pickup. Tesla's rival does not make a lot of noise and Elon Musk, the whimsical and charismatic CEO of Tesla, himself noticed it. This is the South Korean vehicle manufacturer Hyundai  (HYMLF) . Sawyer Merritt, a Musk fan and Tesla investor, recently shared a screenshot showing the top 5 automakers by market share in the electrical sector in the United States. In this ranking, Tesla is well ahead in first place with 75.8% of the market share, followed by Hyundai with 9%, followed by Volkswagen with 4.6% and Ford 4.5%. The rest of the manufacturers complete the ranking with a combined 6.1%. Musk, who is known for rarely uttering the names of Tesla rivals, commented on the post.

In fact, it's reasonable to say Tesla's results would have been stronger if not for supply chain challenges constraining demand. But analysts generally agree that if demand were to slow noticeably in the second half of the year, it could add pressure to Tesla's bottom line at a time of high costs. That would likely hit the stock, which is down 35% so far in 2022. \"We suspect that the interplay of price and cost may matter most for Tesla earnings this year,\" JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a note to clients. \"This interplay we believe presents downside risk to 2Q, given that Tesla experienced sharp battery metals inflation (as well as higher other commodity and non-commodity supply chain costs) but the price hikes of upwards of \$10K it announced across its lineup generally apply only to new orders and not to existing reservations (as Rivian tried unsuccessfully earlier this year); however, as the year progresses, this pricing tailwind — should it...",

        "BYD, the Chinese electric vehicle firm partly owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, became the world’s largest electric vehicle maker in the first half of 2022, wrestling the title from Elon Musk's EV giant Tesla in another sign of the Chinese automaker's resilience in the face of COVID-inflicted disruptions that plagued its rivals this year. BYD sold 641,350 new electric vehicles in the first half of this year, compared to Tesla's 564,743, company filings show. Sales at BYD are also growing at a faster pace than at its American counterpart. In the first six months of 2022, BYD sold 486,771 more cars than it did in the first half of 2021, representing an increase of 315%. Tesla, meanwhile, sold 178,693 more vehicles in the first half of this year compared to last, a 46% year-on-year bump. However, the companies' sales don't represent an apples-to-apples comparison. Many of BYD's car sales are plug-in hybrids and use gasoline engines to supplement battery power. Tesla, on the other hand, exclusively sells fully electric cars. China counts both types of vehicles as \"zero-emission.\" BYD's stock price in Hong Kong has barely budged since the firm released the sales figures earlier this week. But investors have been high on BYD since the start of this year despite the bear market in the U.S. and a challenging environment in China. BYD's stock price has risen nearly 25% since the start of this year. In that same timeframe, Tesla's stock price in New York has dropped 42%. Musk, meanwhile, was an early doubter of BYD. “Have you seen their car?” the Tesla CEO told Bloomberg News in 2011. “I don’t think they have a great product.” Tesla has attributed its sluggish growth early this year to COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai that disrupted production at its gigafactory near the city. \"We [lost] a lot of important days of production. And there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also lost many days of production,\" Musk said in a quarterly...",

Musk, meanwhile, was an early doubter of BYD. “Have you seen their car?” the Tesla CEO told Bloomberg News in 2011. “I don’t think they have a great product.” Tesla has attributed its sluggish growth early this year to COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai that disrupted production at its gigafactory near the city. \"We [lost] a lot of important days of production.

        "GE Aviation is set to undergo a series of leadership changes as its parent company, General Electric Co., works to spin off its health care and energy businesses into their own publicly traded companies. On Monday, the company announced GE CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr. will take over as CEO of GE Aviation effective immediately. He replaces John Slattery, who was named CEO in June 2020. Slattery will now be executive vice president and chief commercial officer of the aviation business, which is based in Evendale. The change up comes roughly eight months after Boston-based GE announced plans to split itself into three different public companies: health care, energy and aviation. The health care and energy spin offs are expected to take place in 2023 and 2024 respectively, leaving General Electric itself as an aviation-focused company. GE Aviation, Greater Cincinnati's third-largest manufacturer, has about 9,000 employees in the Cincinnati region, between its headquarters in Evendale, manufacturing facility, support and services in Hebron, and a testing site in Peebles. A spokeswoman was not immediately available to clarify whether Culp would remain based in Boston or if he would move to the Cincinnati region as part of the transition. In a statement, Culp said: “There is tremendous opportunity in aviation over the coming years, and the board and I decided it is the right time for me to take on this expanded role and work even more closely with the team to support our customers, meet the unprecedented demand ramp, and prepare for GE Aviation’s future as an independent public company.”",

        "(Bloomberg) -- First Solar Inc. has decided against building a new factory in the US, citing uncertainties regarding trade policy and tax incentives. The decision is a setback for US President Joe Biden’s efforts to boost domestic solar manufacturing. Solar installations have slowed this year amid a US Commerce Department trade investigation, raising the prospect of tariffs on panels imported from four Southeast Asian nations. While the White House announced this month a two-year moratorium on new tariffs and took steps to encourage American production, Widmar said the moves don’t address underlying issues that give cheap Asian panels an advantage over US producers. He’s seeking instead tax breaks that will give First Solar economic incentives without raising prices for projects using imports.",

Both recently reported record deliveries and have huge expansion plans. Tesla Berlin and now Tesla Austin are starting deliveries, while the Shanghai plant is finally back at full speed. BYD is opening multiple plants this year, launching several new models and expanding into new export markets.

But the BYD Seal is set to take on the Tesla Model 3. Yet even as their EV competition ramps, BYD will supply batteries to Tesla, a senior BYD executive said on June 8. Meanwhile, Tesla faces growing regulatory scrutiny of its self-driving systems, with multiple probes by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. On June 15, the NHTSA released accident data involving driver-assist systems, with Autopilot dominating the list. In late June, China's government offered the strongest signals yet that it will extend some EV subsidies past 2022. Several local governments, including top Tesla market Shanghai, have already boosted EV subsidies. Beijing on June 26 announced new subsidies for EVs and plug-in hybrids. Tesla stock recently set fresh 2022 lows, but is rebounding. BYD stock is up solidly for the year, just below a buy point.",

        "Tesla  (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc. Report shares, fresh off their worst quarterly decline on record, trimmed their slump Friday as investors brace for what could be a grim reading on global deliveries in the coming days. Street forecasts suggest Tesla, which has been hit by a 22 day shutdown at its Shanghai factory that likely loped 60,000 units from its overall total, as well as surging input costs and capital spending required to ramp-up production at new factories in Berlin and Austin, will deliver around 295,000 cars over the three months ending in June. That's down from its first quarter record of 310,048 units and would end a two year run of improving tallies. But indications are that the total may be even worse: analysts have shared what they claim to be consensus estimates collected by Tesla's investor relations team showing a second quarter delivery estimate of \$256,700, comprised mostly of Model 3 and Model Y sedans.  The formal delivery numbers are expected from Tesla on Saturday, but the group has been known to publish them on the first of the month as well. Tesla shares were marked 1% higher in early Friday trading to change hands at \$678.10 each, a move that would trim the stock's year-to-date decline to around 35%. Last month, Tesla boosted the cost of its long-range Model Y by around 5%, to \$65,990, while the base cost for the Model 3 long range sedan rose \$2,000 to \$57,990. Model S prices were increased by \$5,000 to \$104,990. The changes mark the second price increase of this year and the third since last October.  Tesla told investors in April that \"the inflationary impact on our cost structure has contributed to adjustments in our product pricing, despite a continued focus on reducing our manufacturing costs where possible.",

The research, which was released Thursday, focus on newer processor architectures, such as Intel’s Ice Lake. In May, cloud instances resumed solid sequential growth, KeyBanc said, increasing 3% from April and 26% compared with the same period last year. This was led mostly by instances harnessing Intel processors, which increased 4% from April and 18% on the same period last year. The growth was mostly fueled by use of Intel’s Ice Lake processor, which grew 10% month-over-month and 71% year-over-year thanks largely to use in Amazon.com Inc.’s \n        AMZN,\n        +3.58%\n       Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. “We view these results as moderately positive for INTC, given modest share gains in cloud for the first time since September 2021,” wrote KeyBanc analyst John Vinh, in a note released Thursday. See Now: Intel stock suffers worst day of the year after analysts point to AMD as a reason for data-center weakness Shares of Intel gained 3.1% in afternoon trading Friday, boosted by the broader rebound in tech stocks, while Nvidia climbed 4.0% and AMD rose 4.8%, outpacing the S&P 500 index’s \n        SPX,\n        +3.06%\n       2.4% gain.",

        "Writing from the global markets strategy team, where he takes a broader look at the worldwide market situation, JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic lays out the headwinds running against US investors: “First and foremost, an unprecedented squeeze on household purchasing power looks likely to be extended. Business confidence has also deteriorated and an acceleration in hourly labor costs is compressing corporate profit margins. These challenges are further intensified as higher inflation generates more restrictive central bank policy.” Against this backdrop, JPM's stock analysts have picked out two strong defensive plays for investors to consider. These are high-yield dividend payers, with histories of reliable payouts and current dividend yields exceeding 8%. It also doesn’t hurt that both stocks offer investors double-digit upside potential. Using TipRanks database, we examined the details behind these two to find out what else makes them compelling. JPMorgan analyst Jeremy Tonet reviewed this stock, and found it worth a closer inspection. He wrote of Magellan: “While inflation fears permeate the market, MMP stands well positioned to benefit from higher inflation. Already poised for a 6% tariff increase on July 1, MMP could see an even higher increase next year as YTD inflation tracks in the mid-teens... Overall, MMP’s best-in-class corporate governance, financial flexibility, and value-focused management team put the partnership on the short list of MLPs we would feel comfortable holding over the long term.”",

Also weighing in on the stress test, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck cut her price targets for Bank of America Corp. \n        BAC,\n       Citigroup Inc. \n        C\n       and JPMorgan Chase \n        JPM,\n       saying the results suggest that the three banks will need to keep dividends flat, as well as eliminate buybacks and reduce their risk-weighted assets to generate a common equity tier one ratio above their new required minimums.   Breaking down the annual U.S. Federal Reserves stress test released Thursday, Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin said the results “were tough” on Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase and four regional banks: Capital One Financial Corp. \n        COF,\n       Huntington Bancshares Inc. \n        HBAN,\n       PNC Financial Services Group Inc. \n        PNC\n       and “especially” M&T Bank Corp. \n        MTB.\n       After moving mostly lower in the previous sessions, shares of bank stocks rose along with the broad market on Friday, with the Financial Select SPDR ETF \n        XLF\n       up by 1.5% in morning trading Friday, the KBW Bank Index \n        BKX\n       gained 3.1% and the S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       up 2.3%.Bank of America was up 0.8%, while JPMorgan Chase rose 2.5% and Citigroup climbed 3.2%. Goldman Sachs shares rallied 4.9%, Wells Fargo advanced by 7.3% and Morgan Stanley moved up by 5.6%. Coming to some of the same conclusions as Usdin, Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said Bank of America marked the “most disappointing” results in the stress test, with an estimated increase of 90 basis points (0.9 percentage points) in its stress capital buffer, following by JPMorgan Chase with an 80 basis increase in its stress capital buffer.  “Buybacks are likely on hold for BAC and JPM until 1Q23,” Horowitz said. “There were...",

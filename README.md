# text_analysis

Text analyzer that extracts tokens from text for use in full-text search queries and indexes. 

*THIS PACKAGE IS **PRE-RELEASE**, IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND SUBJECT TO DAILY BREAKING CHANGES.*

## Objective

The objective of this package is to provide utilities for analyzing and manipulating text in preparation of constructing a positional index on a corpus of documents.

## Definitions

The following definitions are used throughout the [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/text_indexing/latest/):

* `corpus`- the collection of `documents` for which an `index` is maintained.
* `dictionary` - is a hash of `terms` (`vocabulary`) to the frequency of occurence in the `corpus` documents.
* `document` - a record in the `corpus`, that has a unique identifier (`docId`) in the `corpus`'s primary key and that contains one or more text fields that are indexed.
* `index` - an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) used to look up `document` references from the `corpus` against a `vocabulary` of `terms`. The implementation in this package builds and maintains a positional inverted index, that also includes the positions of the indexed `term` in each `document`.
* `postings` - a separate index that records which `documents` the `vocabulary` occurs in. In this implementation we also record the positions of each `term` in the `text` to create a positional inverted `index`.
* `postings list` - a record of the positions of a `term` in a `document`. A position of a `term` refers to the index of the `term` in an array that contains all the `terms` in the `text`.
* `term` - a word or phrase that is indexed from the `corpus`. The `term` may differ from the actual word used in the corpus depending on the `tokenizer` used.
* `text` - the indexable content of a `document`.
* `token` - representation of a `term` in a text source returned by a `tokenizer`. The token may include information about the `term` such as its position(s) in the text or frequency of occurrence.
* `tokenizer` - a function that returns a collection of `token`s from `text`, after applying a character filter, `term` filter, [stemmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and / or [lemmatizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation).
* `vocabulary` - the collection of `terms` indexed from the `corpus`.

## Interfaces

The package relies on two key interfaces:
* the `ITextAnalyzer` interface; and
* the `TextAnalyzerConfiguration` interface.

### Interface `ITextAnalyzer`

The `ITextAnalyzer` is an interface for a text analyser class that extracts tokens from text for use in full-text search queries and indexes. 

`ITextAnalyzer.configuration` is a `TextAnalyzerConfiguration` used by the [ITextAnalyzer] to tokenize source text.
Provide a `ITextAnalyzer.tokenFilter`  to manipulate tokens or restrict tokenization to tokens that meet criteria for either index or count.

The `tokenize` function tokenizes source text using the `ITextAnalyzer.configuration` and then manipulates the output by applying `ITextAnalyzer.tokenFilter`.

### Interface `TextAnalyzerConfiguration`

The `TextAnalyzerConfiguration` interface exposes language-specific properties and methods used in text analysis: 
* a `characterFilter` that manipulates terms prior to stemming and tokenization (e.g. changing case and / or removing non-word characters);
* a `termFilter` that returns a collection of terms from a term by splitting compound or hyphenated terms or applying stemming and lemmatization. The `termFilter` can also filter out stopwords by returning an empty collection;
* a `sentenceSplitter` returns a list of sentences from text by splitting the text and sentence endings such as periods, exclamations and question marks or line endings; and
* a `termSplitter` returns a list of terms from text by splitting the text at appropriate places like white-space and mid-sentence punctuation.

## Implementations

The `latest version` provides the following implementation classes:
* implementation class `English`, implements `TextAnalyzerConfiguration` and provides text analysis configuration properties for the English language; and
* the `TextAnalyzer` class implements `ITextAnalyzer.tokenize` using a token filter and text analysis configuration passed in as parameters at initialization.

Refer to the package [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/text_analysis/latest/) for more details.

## Usage

Basic English text analysis can be performed by using a `TextAnalyzer` instance with the default configuration and no token filter:

```dart
  /// Use a TextAnalyzer instance to tokenize the [text] using the default 
  /// English configuration.
  final document = await TextAnalyzer().tokenize(text);

```

For more complex requirements, override `TextAnalyzerConfiguration` and/or pass in a `TokenFilter` function to manipulate the tokens after tokenization as shown in the [examples](https://pub.dev/packages/text_analysis/example).

### Install

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  text_analysis: <latest version>
```

In your code file add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:text_analysis/text_analysis.dart';
```

### Examples

[Examples](https://pub.dev/packages/text_analysis/example) are provided.

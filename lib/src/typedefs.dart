///
/// In English, the [source] text is split at:
/// - `U+000A`, NewLine;
/// - `U+000B`, VerticalTabulation;
/// - `U+000C`, FormFeed; and
/// - `U+000D`, CarriageReturn.

/// `TermFilter` - A filter function that returns a collection of terms from term:
/// - return an empty collection if the term is to be excluded from analysis;
/// - return multiple terms if the term is split; and/or
/// - return modified term(s), such as applying a stemmer algorithm.

///
/// In English, the [source] text is split at sentence endings marks such as
/// periods, question marks and exclamation marks. If the [source] contains
/// paragraph ending marks it should also be split at these.
///
/// The sentence splitter should avoid splitting after abbreviations,
/// which may end with period marks.
